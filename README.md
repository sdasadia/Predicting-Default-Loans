# Predicting Default Loans
Machine Learning Algorithm to Predict Default Bank Loans

In this project, I used Landing Club data (found here = https://www.lendingclub.com/info/download-data.action) to 
predict default bank loans.

Methods Used: Decision Tree, Boosting, RandomForest

After a careful analysis, the developed model showed ~70% accuracy on test data. For details check ipython notebook.
